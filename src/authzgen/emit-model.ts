/**
 * The Ory Permission Language model: one namespace per service.
 *
 * Keto takes namespace existence from this file and everything else from
 * tuples. Subject sets resolve natively, so a grant held by a role's members
 * evaluates as stored data; grant points are relation names on the object;
 * and the type-wide object and named sets are reached by checking those
 * objects directly.
 *
 * Objects carry both type and id, so one namespace serves every resource
 * type a service has: `<service>:<type>/<id>` for a resource,
 * `<type>/__all__` for the type-wide object, `__self__` for the singleton.
