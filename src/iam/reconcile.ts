/**
 * Making the graph say what the deployment's roles say.
 *
 * It runs when the service starts, which is also when the roles change: the
 * file arrives as configuration, so an edit rolls the pod and the pod applies
 * it. A role ends up holding exactly its document, whether the deployment named
 * that holding or a service provisioned it at runtime.
 *
 * It never removes a membership. Which people hold which roles is not the
 * file's business — a deployment ships defaults, an operator grants the rest,
 * and dropping what an operator granted because it is absent from a file would
 * be the file quietly overruling them.
